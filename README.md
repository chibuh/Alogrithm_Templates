# Alogrithm Templates

## STL (Standard Template Library):
#### Data Structures:
You must know how to use the following data structures - 
1. strings
2. vectors
3. maps
4. sets
5. queues, priority queues
6. pbds/ordered sets

##### Algorithms/Functions:
1. sort
2. linear search (min_element, max_element, etc.)
3. binary search (including lower_bound and upper_bound)
learn to use comparators.

## Binary Search:
Practice Binary Search in the EDU section of Codeforces. Complete the Binary Search tutorial at IMTO Academy (Try atleast till step 2).

## Two-pointers:

## Pre-computation (e.g., prefix sum, Range Queries):

## Maths/Number Theory:

GCD/LCM using Euclid's algorithm.
Binary exponentiation.
Sieve of Eratosthenes in ``O(nloglogn)`` vs Prime Number generation in ``O(n✓n)``.

## Recursion & Backtracking:

## Dynamic Programming:

You can follow the Adithya Verma Playlist for learning DP.
Solve problems from the [Atcoders DP contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks), atleast up to problem J, for practice.

## Graphs:
#### Implementation:
Familiarize yourself with different ways to represent graphs: 
1. 2D matrix  ``int adj[n][n];``
2. adjacency list
a. ``vector<int> adj;``
b. ``vector<vector<int>> adj;``
  
#### Algorithms:

Master graph traversals: BFS, DFS, in-order, pre-order, post-order.
Path algorithms like Prim's, Kruskal's, and Dijkstra's.
Advanced Topics:

Explore advanced topics like Segment Trees, Tries, etc.

## Additional Tips:
1. Participate in coding contests regularly on platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, and Leetcode.
2. Consider following the tutorials by Striver and [Luv](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-) on YouTube.
3. Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) may contain errors. Use [cp-algorithms](cp-algorithms.com) as a reliable resource for algorithm code and theory.
