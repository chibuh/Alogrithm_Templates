# Alogrithm Templates

## Binary Search:

Practice Binary Search in the EDU section of Codeforces.
Complete the Binary Search tutorial at IMTO Academy (Try atleast till step 2).

## Dynamic Programming:

You can follow the Adithya Verma Playlist for learning DP.
Solve problems from the [Atcoders DP contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks), atleast up to problem J, for practice.

## STL (Standard Template Library):
#### Data Structures:
Learn about strings, vectors, maps, sets, queues, priority queues, and pbds/ordered sets.
##### Algorithms/Functions:
Focus on sorting, linear search, binary search (including lower_bound and upper_bound), and using comparators.

## Recursion & Backtracking:

## Two-pointers:

## Pre-computation (e.g., prefix sum, Range Queries):

## Maths/Number Theory:

Study GCD/LCM using Euclid's algorithm.
Learn about binary exponentiation.
Compare Sieve of Eratosthenes with prime number generation in O(n✓n).

## Graphs:
#### Implementation:
Familiarize yourself with different ways to represent graphs: 
1. 2D matrix  ``int adj[n][n];``
2. adjacency list
a. ``vector<int> adj;``
b. ``vector<vector<int>> adj;``
  
#### Algorithms:

Master graph traversals: BFS, DFS, in-order, pre-order, post-order.
Path algorithms like Prim's, Kruskal's, and Dijkstra's.
Advanced Topics:

Explore advanced topics like Segment Trees, Tries, etc.

## Additional Tips:
1. Participate in coding contests regularly on platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, and Leetcode.
2. Consider following the tutorials by Striver and [Luv](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-) on YouTube.
3. Algorithms on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) may contain errors. Use [cp-algorithms](cp-algorithms.com) as a reliable resource for algorithm code and theory.
